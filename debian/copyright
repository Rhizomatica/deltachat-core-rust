Upstream-Name: deltachat-core
Source: https://github.com/deltachat/deltachat-core
Comment: Upstream source is repacked to remove the following embedded libraries
 which are available in Debian: cyrussasl, libetpan, libiconv, openssl, and
 sqlite. The python bindings are also removed because we don't want to package
 them for now.
Files-Excluded:
 libs/cyrussasl
 libs/libetpan
 libs/libiconv
 libs/openssl
 libs/sqlite
 python
